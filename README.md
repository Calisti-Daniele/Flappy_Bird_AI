# 🐦 Flappy Bird Reinforcement Learning 🚀

This project trains an AI agent to play the classic game **Flappy Bird** using **Reinforcement Learning**. The agent learns how to navigate through pipes by controlling the bird's vertical movement and maximizing its score. 🎮

## 📚 Project Overview

The goal is to implement a **Q-Learning** or **Deep Q-Network (DQN)** algorithm that enables the agent to make smart decisions during gameplay. As the agent interacts with the game, it will improve its performance over time, learning when to "flap" or not to "flap" to avoid obstacles and stay alive.

## 🛠️ Features

- **Reinforcement Learning** with Q-Learning or DQN 🤖
- Flappy Bird game environment 🌳
- Training progress visualization 📊
- Save and load the trained model 🧠
